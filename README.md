# Hi, I'm Justin 👋

## About Me
I’m a technically driven student with a strong focus on low-level systems, embedded development, and rigorous problem-solving. I care about correctness, performance, and understanding how things work under the hood—not just making them pass.

I enjoy tackling problems that force me to reason precisely, debug systematically, and optimize deliberately.
