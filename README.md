# Hi, I'm Justin 👋

## About Me
I am pursuing a Bachelor’s degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, with a focused interest in embedded systems and robotics. I’m drawn to building hardware-driven systems from the ground up and enjoy hands-on embedded projects that emphasize low-level programming, direct hardware interaction, and precise system behavior.
